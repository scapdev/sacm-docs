      <t>This document identifies foundational use cases, derived functional capabilities and requirements, 
        architectural components, and the supporting standards needed to define an interoperable,
        automation\infrastructure required to support timely, accurate and actionable situational awareness
        over an organization's IT systems.  Automation tools implementing a continuous monitoring approach 
        will utilize this infrastructure together with existing and emerging event, incident and network 
        management standards to provide visibility into the state of assets, user activities and
        network \behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant 
        security and operational data to understand the organizations security posture, quantify business 
        risk, and make informed decisions that support organizational objectives while protecting critical 
        information.  Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment and automate information 
        sharing activities to collaborate with partners to identify and mitigate threats. Other automation 
        tools will be able to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions 
        to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the overall attack surface.</t>

    <section title="Key Concepts" anchor="sec-intro-key-concepts">
      <t>The operational methods we use within the bounds of our present realities are failing us - we are falling behind.  We have begun to recognize that the evolution of threat agents, increasing system complexity, rapid situational security change, and scarce resources are detrimental to our success.  There have been efforts to remedy our circumstance, and these efforts are generally known as "Security Automation."</t>
      
      <t>Security Automation is a general term used to reference standards and specifications originally created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and/or the MITRE Corporation.  Security Automation generally includes languages, protocols (prescribed ways by which specification collections are used), enumerations, and metrics.</t>
      
      <t>These specifications have provided an opportunity for tool vendors and enterprises building customized solutions to take the appropriate steps toward enabling Security Automation by defining common information expressions.  In effect, common expression of information enables interoperability between tools (whether customized, commercial, or freely available).  Another important capability common expression provides is the ability to automate portions of security processes to gain efficiency, react to new threats in a timely manner, and free up security personnel to work on more advanced problems within the processes in which they participate.</t>

      <t>The figure above provides some context for our focus area.  Organizations of all sizes will have a more or less formal risk management program, depending upon their maturity and organization-specific needs.  A small business with only a few employees may not have a formally recognized risk management program, but they still lock the doors at night.  Typically, financial entities and governments sit at the other end of the spectrum with often large, laborious risk frameworks.  The point is that all organizations practice, to some degree, Operational Risk Management.  An Information Risk Management program is most likely a constituent of Operational Risk Management (another constituent might be Financial Risk Management).  In the Information Risk Management domain, we often use Control Frameworks to provide guidance for organizations practicing ORM in an information context, and these Control Frameworks define a variety of Controls.</t>
      
      <t>From ORM, IRM, Control Frameworks, and the Controls themselves, organizations derive a set of organization-specific policies, processes, and procedures.  Such policies, processes, and procedures make use of a library of supporting information commonly stipulated by the organization (i.e. enterprise acceptable use policies), but often prescribed by external entities (i.e. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, Sarbanes-Oxley, or EU Data Privacy Directive).  The focus of this document spans Controls, certain aspects of policy, process, and procedure, and Control Frameworks.</t>

    <section title="Functional Capabilities" anchor="sec-functional-capabilities">
      <t>In general, the activities of managing
        assets, configurations, and vulnerabilities are common between UC1 and UC2.  UC1 uses these
        activities to either grant or deny an entity access to a requested resource.  UC2 uses these
        activities in support of compliance measurement on a periodic basis.</t>
      
      <t>At the most basic level, an enterprise needing to satisfy UC1 and UC2 will need certain
      capabilities to be met.  Specifically, we are talking about risk management capabilities.  This is the central problem domain, so it makes sense to be able to convey
      information about technical and non-technical controls, benchmarks, control requirements,
      control frameworks and other concepts in a common way.</t>
      
      <section title="Capabilities Supporting UC1" anchor="uc1-capabilities">
        <t>As described in Section <xref target="system-state-assessment-uc"></xref>, the required capabilities need to support assessing host
          and/or network state in an automated manner.  This is, essentially, a configuration
          assessment check before allowing a full connection to the network.</t>
        
        <!-- TODO: Need to add additional information here once the use case is really fleshed out to make for a better transition.  Should be something that describes the capabilities already included in this section below. -->
        
       
        <section title="Asset Management" anchor="asset-management-capabilities">
          <t>Effective Asset Management is a critical foundation upon which all else in risk
            management is based.  There are two important facets to asset managment: 1)
            understanding coverage (how many assets are under control) and, 2) understaning specific
            asset details.  Coverage is fairly straightforward - assessing 80% of the enterprise is
            better than assessing 50% of the enterprise.  Getting asset details is comparatively
            subtle - if an enterprise does not have a precise understanding of its assets, then all
            acquired data and consequent actions are considered suspect.  Assessing assets (managed
            and unmanaged) requires that we see and properly characterize our assets at the outset and over time.</t>
          
          <t>What we need to do initially is discover and characterize our assets, and then identify them in a common way.  Characterization may take the form of logical characterization or security characterization, where logical characterization may include business context not otherwise related to security, but which may be used as information in support of decision making later in risk management workflows.</t>
          
          <t>The following list details the requisite Asset Management capabilities (later described in <xref target="functional-components"/>):
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Discover assets in the enterprise</t>
              <t>Characterize assets according to security and non-security asset properties</t>
              <t>Identify and describe assets using a common vocabulary between implementations</t>
              <t>Reconcile asset representations originating from disparate tools</t>
              <t>Manage asset information throughout the asset's life cycle</t>
            </list>
          </t>
        </section>
        
        <section title="Data Collection" anchor="data-collection-capabilities">
          <t>Related to managing assets, and central to any automated assessment solution is the ability to collect data from target hosts (some might call this "harvesting").  Of particular interest are data representing the security state of a target, be it a computing device, network hardware, operating system, or application.  The primary interest of the activities demanding data collection is centered on object state collection, where objects may be file attributes, operating system and/or application configuration items, and network device configuration items among others.</t>
         
          
          <section title="Security Configuration Management" anchor="scm-capabilities">
            <t>There are many valid perspectives to take when considering required capabilities, but the industry seems to have roughly settled upon the notion of "Security Configuration Management" (there are variants of the term).  Security Configuration Management (SCM) is a simple way to reference several supporting capabilities involving technical and non-technical assessment of systems.</t>

            <t>SCM is only part of the solution, as it deals exclusively with the configuration of computing devices, including software vulnerabilities (by testing for patch levels). All vulnerabilities need to be addressed as part of a comprehensive risk management program, which is a superset of software vulnerabilities.  Thus, the capability of assessing non-software vulnerabilities applicable to the in-scope system is required.</t>

          <t>Capabilities supporting Content Management should provide the ability to create/define or modify content, as well as store and retrieve said content of at least the following types:

      <section title="Capabilities Supporting UC2" anchor="uc2-capabilities">
        <t>UC2 is dependent upon UC1 and, therefore, includes all of the capabilities described in Section <xref target="uc1-capabilities"/>.  UC2 describes the ability to make a resource access decision based on an assessment of the requesting system (either by the system itself or on behalf of a user operating that system).  There are two chief capabilities required to meet the needs expressed in Section <xref target="enforcement-of-acceptable-state-uc"/>: Assessment Query and Transport, and Acceptable State Enforcement.</t>
        
        <section title="Assessment Query and Transport" anchor="assessment-transport-capability">
          <t>Under certain circumstances, the system requesting access may be unknown, which can make querying the system problematic (consider a case where a system is connecting to the network and has no assessment software installed). Note that The Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA) protocols (<xref target="RFC5792">PA-TNC</xref>, <xref target="RFC5793">PB-TNC</xref>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-nea-pt-tls">PT-TLS</xref>, and <xref target="I-D.ietf-nea-pt-eap">PT-EAP</xref>) may be used to query and transport the things to be measured.</t>
        </section>
        
        <section title="Acceptable State Enforcement" anchor="state-enforcement-capability">
          <t>Once the assessment has been performed a decision to allow or deny access to the requested resource can be made.  Making this decision is a necessary but insufficient condition for enforcement of acceptable state, and an implementation must have the ability to actively allow or deny access to the requested resource.  For example, network enforcement may be implemented with <xref target="RFC2865">RADIUS</xref> or <xref target="RFC3588">DIAMETER</xref>.</t>

      <section title="Capabilities Supporting UC3" anchor="uc3-capabilities">
        <t>Recall that UC3 is dependent upon UC1 and therefore includes all of the capabilities described in <xref target="uc1-capabilities"/>.  The difference in UC3 is the notion of when to assess rather than what to assess.  Therefore, the capabilities described in this section are relevant only to the "when" and not to the "what."</t>
        
        <section title="Tasking and Scheduling" anchor="task-schedule-capabilities">
          <t>The ability to task and schedule assessments is requisite for any effective risk management program.  Tasking refers to the ability to create a set of instructions to be conveyed at a later time via scheduling.  Tasking, therefore, involves selecting a set of assessment criteria, assigning that set to a group of assets, and expressing that information in a manner that can be consumed by a collection tool.  Scheduling comes into play when the enterprise determines when to perform a specific assessment task (or set of tasks).  Scheduling may be expressed in a way that constrains tasks to execute only during defined periods, can be ad hoc, or may be triggered by the analysis of previous assessment results or events detected in the enterprise.</t>
          
          <t>The following capabilities support Tasking and Scheduling:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>Selection of assessment criteria</t>
              <t>Defining in-scope assets (i.e. targeting)</t>

        </section>
        
        <section title="Data Aggregation and Reporting" anchor="aggregation-reporting-capabilities">
          <t>Assessment results are produced for every asset assessed, and these results must be reported not only individually, but in the aggregate, and in accordance with enterprise needs.  Enterprises should be able to aggregate and report on the data their assessments produce in a number of different ways in order to support different levels of decision making.  At times, security operations personnel may be interested in understanding where the most critical risks exist in their enterprise so as to focus their remediation efforts in the most effective way (in terms of cost and return).  At other times, only aggregated scores will matter, as might be the case when reporting to an information security manager or other executive-level role.</t>
          
          <t>It is not the position of these capabilities to provide explicit details about how reports should be formatted for presentation, but only what information they should contain for a particular purpose.  Furthermore, it is quite easy to imagine the need for a capability providing extensibility to aggregation and reporting.</t>

      <t>Document where existing work exists, what is currently defined by SDOs, and any gaps that should be addressed.  Point to existing event, incident and network management standards when available.  Describe emerging efforts that may be used for the creation of new standards.  For gaps provide insight into what would be a good fit for SACM or another IETF working groups.</t>
      <t>This will help us to identify what is needed for SACM to be successful. This section will help determine which of the specifications can be normatively referenced and what needs to be addressed in the IETF.

      <t>Things to address:
        <list>
          <t>For IETF related efforts, discuss work in NEA and MILE working groups. Address SNMP, NetConf and other efforts as needed.</t>

        <t>The functional capabilities described in <xref target="sec-functional-capabilities"/> require a significant number of models to be selected or defined in order to meet the needs of the three use cases presented in <xref target="sec-use-cases"/>.  A "model" in this sense is a logical arrangement of information that may have more than one syntactic binding.  For the purpose of this document, only the logical data model is considered.  However, where appropriate, example data models that may have well-defined syntactic expressions may be referenced.</t>
